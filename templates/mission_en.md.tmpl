# Mission — Rules of Engagement

This file defines the rules of engagement for the Expedition.
All Expeditioners must read this file and carry out their mission.

---

## Obtaining the Mission

1. Use Linear MCP to retrieve unfinished issues (all statuses except Done — including issues stalled in Testing or In Review from previous Expeditions)
2. Choose an issue matching the difficulty indicated by the **Gradient Gauge**

## Mission Assessment

Analyze the issue content and classify it into one of three types:

### implement

Code implementation, feature additions, refactoring, etc.

### verify

E2E testing, UI review, checklist completion, behavior verification, etc.
Criteria: description contains keywords like "test", "check", "verify", "QA", "E2E",
or includes a checklist (`- [ ]`).

### fix

Automatically transitions from verify results. Expeditioners do not select this directly.

## implement Procedure

1. `git checkout <base-branch> && git pull origin <base-branch>`
2. Create branch: `feat/<issue-id>-<short-description>`
3. TDD: write tests -> implement -> make tests pass
4. Commit frequently (include issue ID in commit messages)
5. Run lint / format checks
6. If it still fails after 3 fix attempts -> skip (record lesson in journal)
7. `gh pr create` to create PR (body includes `Closes <issue-id>`)
8. Update issue to "In Review" via Linear MCP

## verify Procedure

1. Confirm dev server is running (check URL accessibility)
2. Open browser via Chrome DevTools MCP and navigate to target page
3. Execute checklist items **one by one**:
   a. Interact with UI
   b. Compare expected vs actual results
   c. Take screenshot (Chrome DevTools MCP Page.captureScreenshot)
   d. Record result (Pass / Fail + details)
4. Create QA report and comment on issue via Linear MCP
5. **If no defects**: update issue to "Done"
6. **If defects found**: -> transition to fix

## fix Procedure (auto-transition from verify)

For each defect:

1. File a bug issue via Linear MCP
2. `git checkout <base-branch> && git pull origin <base-branch>`
3. Branch: `fix/<bug-issue-id>-<short-description>`
4. Implement fix and write tests
5. `gh pr create` to create PR (body includes `Closes <bug-issue-id>`)

## Prohibitions

- Do not force push
- Do not commit directly to the base branch
- Do not create a PR with failing tests
- Do not stop the dev server (managed by external process)
- Do not modify `.expedition/mission.md`

## Handling Ambiguity

- Execute ambiguous items using best judgment and record reasoning in journal
- Skip issues with unclear specs and record in journal
- If unsure, skip and leave it to the next Expedition
